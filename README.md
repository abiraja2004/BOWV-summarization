# BOWV-summarization

BOWV-summarization is a automatic summarization system, which base on the bag of word vectors (BOWV) representation.

BOWV is a semantic representation, which can represent words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs and documents in a same vector space. In the BOWV space, we can approximately measure the semantic similarity with the distance between BOWV representations. We utilize it for extractive automatic summarization.
