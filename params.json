In the BOWV space, we can approximately measure the semantic similarity with the distance between BOWV representations. We utilize it for extractive automatic summarization.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\n    summarization.py [-k sentence-num] [-v word-vector-version] file\r\n        file: the text file to be obtained a summary\r\n\t    sentence-num: the number of extracted sentence, default is 5\r\n\t    word-vector-version: 0-5, default is 0 ...\r\n\t\t    0\t glove.6B.50d.txt\r\n\t\t    1\t glove.6B.100d.txt\r\n\t\t    2\t glove.6B.200d.txt\r\n\t\t    3\t glove.6B.300d.txt\r\n\t\t    4\t glove.42B.300d.txt\r\n\t\t    5\t glove.840B.300d.txt\r\n\r\n##Examples\r\n\r\n    $python summarization.py example/dlbook-c1.md\r\n\r\nThe automatic extractive summary of the [1st chapter](example/dlbook-c1.md) in the [deep learning book from Yoshua Bengio](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/dlbook/).\r\n\r\n>Deep learning is a particular kind of machine learning that achieves great power and flexibility by learning to represent the world as a nested hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined in relation to simpler concepts.\r\n>Fig 1 shows how a deep learning system can represent the concept of an image of a person by combining simpler concepts, such as corners and contours, which are in turn defined in terms of edges.\r\n>Deep learning solves this central problem in representation learning by introducing representations that are expressed in terms of other, simpler representations.\r\n>A major source of difficulty in many real-world artificial intelligence applications is that many of the factors of variation influence every single piece of data we are able to observe.\r\n>The introduction of machine learning allowed computers to tackle problems involving knowledge of the real world and make decisions that appear subjective.\r\n\r\n    $python summarization.py -v 4 -k 4 example/news.md \r\n\r\nThe automatic extractive summary of a [news](example/news.md) from [CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/24/asia/japan-robots-work/index.html).\r\n\r\n>Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ is trying out \"Nao,\" a customer service robot that answers basic questions and is designed to speak 19 languages.\r\n>A growing number of Japanese businesses are testing out robots as a possible solution to the country's shrinking workforce.\r\n>But he says the technology is evolving quickly and someday, robots like Chihira could replace humans for certain jobs.\r\n>The regular greeter, Ayako Seiryu, says she's not worried about a robot replacing her -- even one made to resemble a real 32-year-old woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
